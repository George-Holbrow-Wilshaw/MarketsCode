    "#### Method 1 - Bootstrapping from 1M SOFR Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "1M SOFR Futures have the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unlike 3M Futures which are based on a business day compounded rate; 1M SOFR Futures are priced based on an arithmetic average across **calendar** days:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{SR1} = [1 -  \\frac{1}{N_m}\\sum_{d=1}^{N_m}r_{d}] \\times 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the front contract, we can split this equation into SOFR fixings vs 1 day forward SOFR:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{SR1} = [1 -  \\frac{1}{N_m}(\\sum_{d=1}^{n_{obs}}r_{d}^{fix} + \\sum_{d=n_{fwd}}^{N_m}r_{d}^{fwd})] \\times 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Although SOFR fixings fluctuate on a daily basis, they tend to jump following FOMC meets by the amount of any rate decision. We can therefore further split the above equation into fixings, fwd SOFR pre-meet, fwd SOFR post-meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{SR1} = [1 -  \\frac{1}{N_m}(\\sum_{d=1}^{n_{obs}}r_{d}^{fix} + \\sum_{d=n_{fwd:pre}}^{n_{meet}}r_{d}^{fwd:pre} + \\sum_{d=n_{meet}}^{N_m}r_{d}^{fwd:post})] \\times 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For the purpose of this exercise, I have made a simplifying assumption that SOFR will remain constant between meeting dates (note that I will relax this assumption slightly later). For the front contract, the pre-meet SOFR is assumed to remain at the last fixing. This leaves us with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{SR1} = [1 -  \\frac{1}{N_m}(\\sum_{d=1}^{n_{obs}}r_{d}^{fix} + r_{n_{obs}}^{fix} \\times (n_{meet} - n_{obs}) + \\sum_{d=n_{meet}}^{N_m}r_{d}^{fwd:post})] \\times 100$$\n",
    "$$P_{SR1} = [1 -  \\frac{1}{N_m}(\\sum_{d=1}^{n_{obs}}r_{d}^{fix} + r_{n_{obs}}^{fix}(n_{meet} - n_{obs}) + r^{fwd:post}(N_m - n_{meet}))] \\times 100$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now we can rearrange the above and solve for the one unknown parameter $r_{d}^{fwd:post}$ which is the forward SOFR rate post meeting\n",
